Update Oct 2, 2023

Imported Raw data into MySQL database in the MySQL docker container.



After being unable to access NUFORC's API. I realized there was none and that others had the same issue. The below data import is courtesy of the following [data set]([GitHub - planetsig/ufo-reports: NUFORC geolocated and time standardized ufo reports for close to a century of data. 80,000 plus reports.](https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports))
